      # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
      # Instructions: You should first compute the covariance matrix. Then, you
      #               should use the "svd" function to compute the eigenvectors
      #               and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. 
      #
      # Note: When computing the covariance matrix, remember to divide by m (the
      #       number of examples).
